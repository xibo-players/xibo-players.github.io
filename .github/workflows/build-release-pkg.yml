name: Build xiboplayer-release packages

# Builds the xiboplayer-release RPM and DEB — the repo-config packages
# that users install to add the Xibo Players repository to their system.
#
# These packages ship a .repo/.sources file and GPG key, nothing else.
# Built packages are uploaded to a GitHub Release; update-repos.yml then
# fetches and indexes them alongside all other packages.
